The packages used were PyQt5 and Cryptography. The development of the app started with the planning of the core features. Once a set of basic requirements were established, work began on researching a means of encrypting text for Python. The Cryptography package was the method used to encrypt the text.</p><br><p>The first full version of the app ran purely on the command line. At this point in development, you were able to save encrypted passwords to a JSON file and have them decrypted and displayed on the command line. I soon realized that this wasn't very intuitive, so I expanded the scope of the project to include a GUI.</p><br><p>I began researching ways to create a GUI for Python, and I soon discovered PyQt5. Over the next few days, I began experimenting with PyQt5, learning how to properly use it as quickly as I could. Once I became familiar with the technology and had some rough sketches of the GUI, I began implementing the design.</p><div class=\"row justify-content-center\"><figure class=\"col-sm-6\"><img src=\"../../assets/pm-first.PNG\" alt=\"Main Window With Passwords Hidden\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid\"><figcaption class=\"text-center\">Main Window - Passwords Hidden</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"col-sm-6\"><img src=\"../../assets/pm-second.PNG\" alt=\"Main Window With Passwords Visible\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid\"><figcaption class=\"text-center\">Main Window - Passwords Visible</figcaption></figure></div><br><p>The finished product, which I have dubbed \"PmPro\", has the features you would expect of a basic password management application. On the main window, there are 4 buttons on the top, \"Add New Password\", \"Refresh\", \"Delete\", and \"Regen Key\". The first option is self-explanatory, it allows you to add a new password entry to the file, and you can also add a platform to which the password belongs. The second option will refresh the table that displays the passwords. The third option allows you to delete a selected password. The fourth and final option refreshes the encryption key and re-encrypts your passwords with the new key.</p><div class=\"row justify-content-center\"><figure class=\"col-sm-3\"><img src=\"../../assets/pm-third.PNG\" alt=\"Add Password Window\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid\"><figcaption class=\"text-center\">Add Password</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"col-sm-3\"><img src=\"../../assets/pm-fourth.PNG\" alt=\"Delete Password Window\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid\"><figcaption class=\"text-center\">Delete Password</figcaption></figure></div>"
